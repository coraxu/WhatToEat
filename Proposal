As the name suggests, WhatToEat is a web application that decides to what to eat for the user. Current restaurant apps, and recipe apps bombard the users with options and information. It is up to the user to decide from milliards of choices provided by the applications. WhatToEat, on the other hand, identifies the user’s information from the login data, and narrows the choices. The main idea is to alleviate the user’s pain of having to evaluate all the different possibilities to make one optimal choice. The app mostly targets young adults who are comfortable utilizing web applications for choosing restaurants. However, it is open to users of all ages who wants to make a good meal choice in a given circumstances. Our plan is to use the map API and weather API to identify the environment the user is in, and then use food API’s to suggest few choices of optimal meal options. Below are some possible scenarios where WhatToEat can come in handy:

•	A typical rainy weekend in Vancouver, Joe wants something for brunch that suits the weather. He has a vague idea, maybe something warm and with a soup, but can't quite put his finger on one menu. Hamburger and Pizza may be sunny day food, Steaks are too heavy for brunch, and he never had Transylvanian cuisine to know whether it is good for rainy days. He wants to decide what he is going to be eating, before getting out of his bed and get ready for the meal.

•	One sunny afternoon, after walking along the Sea Wall, Titus and Kimmy get hungry. Walking along the beautiful ocean got them hankering for some seafood. They are just not sure whether it is a good idea to have some raw seafood like oysters, or sushi on a warm sunny day. They just want to have some seafood, if any, without taking a whole food safety course.

•	Will and Grace are having five friends over for a dinner. Neither of them wants to cook, and they decide to cater. The issue is, one of their friends is vegetarian, one of them lactose intolerant, one of them allergic to peanuts, one of them a gluten-free enthusiast, and the last one a professional body builder who insists that substantial amount of protein be included in every one of his meals. Will and Grace do not have enough time to call individual restaurants and pick them up. Neither do they have will-power to call each restaurant and find out whether they can 
satisfy all five friends from an order from a restaurant.
