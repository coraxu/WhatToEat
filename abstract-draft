WhatToEat is an online web application that decides users what should they eat given specific conditions. WhatToEat will utilize a map API and/or a weather API to factor in conditions such as user's locations and the weather conditions to help decide what should the user eat. WhatToEat can also help decide if they should eat at a restaurant or cook at home instead, and will provide recipes should they decide to cook at home.
